# ScannerIPLOGGERS GUI
create python files using the "requests" library to make HTTP requests and "beautifulsoup4" to parse the HTML of web pages:

This Discord bot listens for the !scan command followed by a link as an argument. Then, use the scan_link() function to scan the link for malicious content. In this simple example, you simply check to see if the page title contains the string "IP Logger," but you can expand this method by implementing your own malicious content detection rules.

Remember to replace 'TU_TOKEN' with your Discord bot's token.
